# Video Colourization
An attempt to colour old black-and-white videos using DL techniques. A number of repos were implemented and also built our own fusion network. Refer to DL_Project_Proposal.pdf and Group18_DL_Project_Presentation.pdf for work details. All references we used are listed in Links.txt. Our video colourization results can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WIKmrpEU8WhUfGI-iR5m2b7_wxYTj-BU?usp=sharing
